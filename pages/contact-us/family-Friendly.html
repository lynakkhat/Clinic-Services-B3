        <h3>2. Flexible Visiting Policies</h3>
            <p id="phas"><li>Extended Visiting Hours: Allow flexible or extended visiting hours, especially for pediatric, maternity, and intensive care units, to help families spend more time with their loved ones.</li></p>
            <p id="phas"><li>Family Accommodations: In cases where a family member needs to stay overnight, offer recliners, sleeping chairs, or nearby family rooms for comfort. Consider providing cots or blankets if space allows.</li></p>
        <h3>3. Support Services for Families</h3>
